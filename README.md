# Data_types_in_C-
## Aim
We leaern about all data types in C++.
## Theory
In C++, data types define the type of data that a variable can hold, determining memory allocation and permissible operations. The primary data types include `int` for integers, which typically occupies 4 bytes and stores whole numbers; `char` for single characters, requiring 1 byte; `float` and `double` for floating-point numbers, with `float` using 4 bytes for single-precision and `double` using 8 bytes for double-precision; and `bool` for boolean values, representing true or false and typically taking 1 byte. Derived data types include arrays, which are collections of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations, and pointers, which store memory addresses. Additionally, structures (`struct`) and unions (`union`) are user-defined types that group different types of data together, while enumerated types (`enum`) allow the creation of named integer constants for improved code readability. Understanding these data types is crucial for efficient memory management and precise programming in C++.
